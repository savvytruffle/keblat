Keblat simultaneously fits multi-band (SED) and time-series (Kepler light curve) photometric data for an eclipsing binary from the Villanova KEB catalogue. It utilizes Padova isochrones (stored in data/) and the Mandel & Agol (2002) code in C, with rsky function adapted from L. Kreidberg. Requires the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) in C. 
 
This repo contains the source code that produced the fits to the paper "Modeling Kepler Eclipsing Binaries: Homogeneous Inference of Orbital & Stellar Properties" by Windemuth et al. (2019). Plots of SED+LC fits from maximum-likelihood solutions can be found in data/plots/ml/, and corner plots of posterior distributions can be found in data/plots/posteriors/. Thinned versions of the MCMC files can be downloaded at https://zenodo.org/record/3357009

You can install GSL by:
- download v2.1 here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/gsl-2.1.tar.gz
- untar into desired directory
- follow instructions in the INSTALL file; if you do not have root access, append --prefix=/path/to/dir during ./configure
- to include GSL functions into your own code, make sure to link the library during compilation/in your makefile

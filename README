Keblat simultaneously fits multi-band (SED) and time-series (Kepler light curve) photometric data for an eclipsing binary from the Villanova KEB catalogue. It utilizes Padova isochrones (stored in data/) and the Mandel & Agol (2002) code in C. Requires the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) in C. 

You can install GSL by:
- download v2.1 here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/gsl-2.1.tar.gz
- untar into desired directory
- follow instructions in the INSTALL file; if you do not have root access, append --prefix=/path/to/dir during ./configure
- to include GSL functions into your own code, make sure to link the library during compilation/in your makefile
 

This repo contains the source code that produced the fits to the paper "Modeling Kepler Eclipsing Binaries: Homogeneous Inference of Orbital & Stellar Properties" by Windemuth et al. (2019). Plots of fits from maximum-likelihood solutions can be found in data/mlplots/. Thinned versions of the MCMC files can be downloaded at https://zenodo.org/record/3357009

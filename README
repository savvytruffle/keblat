Keblat simultaneously fits SED and Kepler lightcurve data given an eclipsing binary from the Villanova KEB catalogue. It utilizes Padova isochrones (stored in data/) and a fast Mandel & Agol code implemented in Python/C by L. Kreidberg (in c_code/ and ext_func/; compile with 'bash build.sh'). Requires the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) in C. 

You can install GSL by:
- download v2.1 here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/gsl-2.1.tar.gz
- untar into desired directory
- follow instructions in the INSTALL file; if you do not have root access, append --prefix=/path/to/dir during ./configure
- to include GSL functions into your own code, make sure to link the library during compilation/in your makefile
